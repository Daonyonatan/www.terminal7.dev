    Terminal7 uses WebRTC's data channels to send
    keystrokes and stream output. Part of the W3C
    standard, data channels use IETF's SCTP & DTLS for
    performace and security.

    Terminal7 comes with an address book and signaling service - PeerBook.
    PeerBook uses ICE protocol magic, connecting Terminal7 to
    behind-the-NAT servers. Use your desktop or home-hosted Raspberry Pi
    and save on hosting costs.
