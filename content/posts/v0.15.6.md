We hope this version finds you well. It introduces a new online service -
peerbook - letting you connect to behind-the-NAT servers and keeping an address
book of peers. With peerbook you don’t have to key addresses or copy tokens.

Changes to your peerbook are authorized by a short lived link. The link is
either automatically emailed to you when a you start a new peer or when you
request it at https://pb.terminal.dev. peerbook is also a websocket server,
trimming setup time by enabling tickle-ICE. peerbook’s data is stored in GCP
and the code is released under an MIT license.

To use peerbook you need to install our latest webexec program on your sever.
If it’s a fresh installation you just need to run `webexec init` and enter your
email. If you already have a `~/.webexec/webexec.conf` you can edit it and add
the `peerbook` section. The section requires an `email` field and an optional
`name` for the hostname.  We’ve taken great pains to make it stable, but still…
it rarely freezes on return to the foreground. To unfreeze, you can either use
the reset button to restart the connection or you can switch to another app and
switch back after a few seconds. It’s a sneaky bug whose day will come.
