We're getting ready for 1.0 with this bug fixing version. Biggest bug is
annoying restore-when-zoomed bug which was squashed. 

The only new feature is for debug purposes: pressing CMD-` copies the last 100
lines of the log to the clipboard so you can send it to us when bugs show their
ugly heads.
With this version we are starting funding issue on
https://issuehunt.io/r/tuzig/terminal7 if you like JavaScript please consider
joining the hunt. If you don't find anything you can help with or prefer to go
in code, please check back soon as more hunts will follow.
