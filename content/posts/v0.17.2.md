In a few hours a new beta version will be approved for TestFlight.
This is a quickfix, restoring touch support. I'm sorry, but this bug slipped
though my keyboard-bound fingers. I hope no screens were damaged and no fingers
bruised in failed splits.

The bug resulted from an explosive combination of a new xtermjs, a bit of
codelong overdue for refactor and me slacking on my job as release manager.

Minor versions should tested by a human. With v0.17.0 it didn't happen. I have
only the most common excuse: I didn't have time, there was a bug with static
IPs so I rushed the version.

BIG MISTAKE - when rushing things, quality suffers.

This version should work much better. I used to opportunity to beautify the
search  box. It was hurting my eyes and the layout is much better now. Please
give it try.
